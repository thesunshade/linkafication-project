    
    Ap has 13 citations, all of them single numbers ranging from 16 to 347 (except for Ap.16.193). His book gives this as ApadƒÅna, ed. Mary E. Littey, PTS Oxford 2000
    
    
    
    Bv has 21 citations in the form of two arabic numbers with the lowest being Bv.1.36 and the highest Bv.34.11 There are 24 chapters in the Bv so I'm stumped

    There is a single Nidd.ii.304 citation. I assumed this was Cullaniddesa, however that only seems to go up to page 73.
