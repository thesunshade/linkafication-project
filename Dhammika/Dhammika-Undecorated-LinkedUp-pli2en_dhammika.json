The Kathiawari, India’s indigenous horse, was probably derived from the cross-breeding of Sindh and Arab horses in the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Horses were too expensive to be used for ordinary transport and were reserved mainly for royalty,for chariots and for cavalry during war. Chariots and cavalry were two of the four branches of the army. The importance of horses in ancient India is suggested by the space given to their care, maintenance and training in the <em>Arthaśāstra</em>.</p><p>A horse fit for a king was expected to have five qualities; to have a good stud line, when given food, whether green or dried, it should eat it carefully and not scatter it about, it will not lay in its own dung, it should not fight with the other horses, it should show itself as it is to its trainer, and it should pull the carriage properly <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.12/en/sujato#32.1'>AN.iv.188</a>. Horses were trained using gentle means, harsh means and a combination of both <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.109/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.ii.110</a>. This is similar of the <em>Aśvaṣāstra’s</em> advice that a combination of gentleness, rewards and punishment is the best way of training horses. Horses were trained in special grounds and were penned either in stables or in circular corrals and fed steamed rice <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj1/en/brahmali#1.7.2'>Vin.iii.5</a>. We read of the best three-year-old rice fed to a king’s Sindh horse <span class='ref'>Ja.i.178</span>. A good horse would respond even to the shadow of the whip <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.111/en/sujato#4.1'>AN.ii.113</a> and a thoroughbred was expected to be endowed with beauty, stamina, speed <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.95/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.i.243</a> and be finely proportioned <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.140/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.i.288</a>.

It can also grow on the walls of buildings causing them great damage.

This tree is referred to in the four Nikāyas as “The Tree of Awakening” (<em>Bodhirukkha</em>) although it is only mentioned twice (<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn14/en/sujato#1.7.1'>DN.ii.4</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud1.1/en/sujato#1.1'>Ud.1</a> repeated at <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#1.1.1'>Vin.i.1</a>) in the earliest part of the Tipiṭaka.</p><p>Before the Buddha’s enlightenment, the area around the Bodhi Tree was covered with silvery sand without a blade of grass growing on it and all the surrounding trees and flowering shrubs were bending as if in homage towards it <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja479/pli/ms#2.1'>Ja.iv.233</a>. According to the Nidānakathā, the Buddha spent his second week at Uruvelā (i.e. Bodh Gaya) gazing at the Bodhi Tree out of gratitude for the shelter it had offered him <span class='ref'>Ja.i.77</span>. The same text says that as the Buddha sat meditating beneath the Bodhi Tree, <em>aṅkura</em> the colour of red coral sprinkled down on him as if they were an offering <span class='ref'>Ja.i.75</span>. <em>Aṅkura</em> usually means a shoot but here it must refer to the glossy crimson sheathing stipuls that are cast off as the new leaves of Bodhi trees develop.</p><p>In the early centuries of Buddhism, the <em>assattha</em> tree became a symbol of the Buddha and in the sculptures of both Bharhut and Sanchi he is depicted as such. In the <em>Mahāvastu</em>, he is actually given the epitaph “Great Tree” (<em>Mahādruma</em>, <span class='ref'>Mvu.ii.280</span>). A branch of the Bodhi Tree was brought to Sri Lanka by the nun Saṅghamittā, the daughter of King Asoka, in the 2<sup>nd</sup> century BCE and is believed to still grow in Anurādhapura.

Rain water collected in the depression, fruit fell into it and warmed by the sun it fermented. In the summer, thirsty birds drank from the depression, became intoxicated, fell to the ground and after sleeping for a while, flew away.

Concerning the consumption of alcohol, the Buddha said: “Whoever follows the Dhamma should not drink or encourage others to do so, knowing that intoxication is the result. Because of intoxication the fool commits evil deeds and makes others negligent too.

Insects are small six-legged invertebrates of the class Insecta. Some of the different types of insects mentioned by the Buddha include those attracted to the smell of dung, those that live in dark places, others that live in rotting or putrid matter <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn129/en/sujato#19.1'>MN.iii.168</a> and still others, <em><a href='/define/adhipāta'>adhipāta</a></em>, that are attracted to lamps at night <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp4.16/en/sujato#10.1'>Snp verse 964</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud6.8/en/sujato#5.1'>Ud.72</a>.

Scrupulousness towards tiny creatures came to be seen as a sign of the most sensitive compassion as is suggested by Ashvaghosa’s description of the Prince Siddhattha’s reaction to seeing plowing being done. “Clumps of grass turned up by the plow lay scattered on the ground and were covered with tiny dead creatures, insects and worms, and as he saw this he grieved as if one of his own kinsman had been killed” <span class='ref'>Bc.5.5</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

When King Milinda expressed doubt to Nāgasena about the Buddha’s statement that the beginning of <em>saṁsāra</em> cannot be known, Nāgasena asked him in reply: “As an egg comes from a chicken and a chicken from an egg, is there an end to this series?” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mil3.3.2/pli/ms#1.1'>Mil.51</a> This seems to be the earliest use of the well-known and popular “chicken and egg” dilemma.

Sparrows are omnivorous, eating grain, flower buds, grasshoppers and kitchen scraps and make their large untidy nests under the eaves of village houses.</p></dd></dl>"

Again, red sandalwood is unequalled for its lovely fragrance,even so is Nirvāna unequalled for its lovely fragrance.Yet again, red sandalwood is praised by good people; even so is Nirvāna praised by the Noble Ones.

Here is found the white sandalwood tree and the <em>candaneva</em> tree. These two are much alike and the latter can only be distinguished by going in the height of summer to the top of some hill and then looking at a great distance great serpents may be seen entwining it; thus it is known. Its wood is naturally cold and therefore serpents twine round it. After having noted the tree, they shoot an arrow into it to mark it. In the winter after the snakes have gone, the tree is cut down.” Similar stories about where sandlewood grows and the serpants or dragons that live around it are to be found in Sanskrit works such as the <em>Amarakośa</em> and the <em>Kāvyamīmāṁsā</em>.</p></dd><dt>Medical uses for <td><em>Candana</em></td></dt><dd class='uses'><p>Bark: With root bark of<em>Solanum torvum</em> and <em>Achyranthes aspera</em> for malaria.

Snake charmers were a feature of street life in cities and towns <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja365/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.iii.198</a> and they usually used cobras because of their impressive appearance, their ability to stand erect and their tendency to follow and therefore appear to dance to the moving flute played by the charmer. These charmers were believed to use special herbs and magic spells to mesmerize cobras in order to attract and then catch them. They would approach the snake, seize it by the tail, drag it backwards so that it would be stretched out full length and then use what was called a “goat’s foot stick” to pin its head down. Seizing it by the head and applying pressure to the sides would force the cobra’s mouth open so the charmer could spit the juice of certain herbs into it which would, it was believed, break its fangs. Over the next few days the cobra would be subjected to a series of procedures meant to pacify it and get it used to being handled. These procedures were called <em>cuṇṇamāna</em>, <em>tantamajjita</em> and <em>dussapoṭhima</em> and seem to have involved wrapping the cobra in cloth and then stretching, squeezing, massaging and striking it. After this the cobra was ready to be used <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.457</span>. During their performances, charmers would make cobras dance and drape them around their necks <span class='ref'>Ja.i.370</span>. They would feed them with frogs they had killed <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja542/pli/ms#171.1'>Ja.vi.458</a>.

Birds are feathered, egg-laying bipeds of the class Aves. Numerous kinds of birds are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka but not all of these can be identified. However, birds in general are frequently referred to. In the <em>Suśrutasaṁhitā</em> birds are classified as either peckers, scratchers, aquatic or birds of prey, although no attempt is made in the Tipiṭaka to classify them. Birds leave no track as they fly through the sky <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp92/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.92</a>. They flock to big banyan trees to roost, eat the fruit and rest in the shade <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.37/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.42</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.19/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.304</a>. They have beautiful songs; “peacocks scream, herons cry and koels gently warble” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#7.36'>DN.iii.201</a>. The call of some birds sounded to the Indian ear like words, a point made by the grammarian Yāska. The <em>jīvaṁjīvaka’s</em> cry sounded like “Live!” (<em>Jīva</em>) and another bird seemed to say “lift up your hearts”(<em>utthehi citte</em>, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn32/en/sujato#7.36'>DN.iii.201</a>). The monk Rāmaṇeyyaka said that the chirping and twittering of the birds in the forest did not disturb his meditation <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag1.49/en/sujato#1.1'>Thag.49</a>. Whether in the forest or at the edge of the village, the bird songs always gave delight. The Jātaka says: “Around and about the trees can be heard the chorus of flocks of <em><a href='/define/najjuhā'>najjuhā</a></em> birds and cuckoos as they fly from one tree to another. Amongst the branches and foliage they sing to passers-by and delight both newcomers and locals” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja547/pli/ms#376.1'>Ja.vi.534</a>. It was observed that birds like peacocks and pigeons sometimes eat pebbles or grit <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mil3.4.5/pli/ms#7.1'>Mil.67</a>. Seafarers took birds with them on their voyages and would release them when they sailed out of sight of land. If the bird returned to the ship they would know they were still far from land <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn11/en/sujato#83.6'>DN.i.222</a>.</p><p>The Buddha said that just as a bird flies off taking only its wings with it, monks or nuns should wander taking only a few simple possessions with them <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#65.1'>DN.i.71</a>. A god once told a monk that just as a bird removes dust from itself after a dust bath with a vigorous shake, an ardent mindful monk should flick off the dust of the defilements <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn9.1/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.197</a>. Birds like domestic fowl, quails and partridges were eaten and “rice with well-dressed fowl” was a popular dish <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp2.2/en/sujato#3.1'>Snp verse 241</a>. Feathers were used to make fans and flights for arrows. Peacock feathers were used for decorative purposes, and the <span class='FontFamilyTimesExtRomanTimesNewRomanSerif'>quills</span>of some feathers were used as sewing needles <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd18/en/brahmali#4.6.10'>Vin.ii.215</a> and to store things in. Some ascetics had cloaks made out of the feathers of certain birds. Domestic fowl and their eggs were an important part of people’s diets. Wild birds like quails and pigeons were hunted for food and their eggs were collected. Hawks were trained to hunt <span class='ref'>Ja.v.275</span>.

As there is no blue lotus this must refer to the blue water lily, more commonly called <em><a href='/define/uppala'>uppala</a></em> in Pāḷi.</p><p>Lotuses grew in the wild but were also planted in bathing tanks and garden ponds for beautification. When in Campa, the Buddha would stay at one such tank, Gaggarā’s Lotus Lake <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn4/en/sujato#1.1'>DN.i.111</a>.

The first was that such a beautiful pure flower emerges from dirty muddy water. To him, this was analogous to the enlightened person’s transcendence of <em>saṁsāra</em>. “Just as the lotus is born in the water and grows up beneath the water, yet remains undefiled by the water, fragrant and beautiful. Just so, the Buddha is born in the world, grows up and dwells in the world but like the lotus unstained by the water, he is not defiled by the world” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.43/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.iii.346</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.94/en/sujato#6.1'>SN.iii.140</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.3/en/sujato#37.1'>Snp verse 71</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thag15.2/en/sujato#12.1'>Thag.700–1</a>. The second thing was the fact that water will not adhere to the lotus leaf. Because of microscopic waxy papillae on the surface of the leaf water splashed on it turns into quicksilver-like drops and immediately slips off, leaving no trace of moisture. “Whoever in the world overcomes this low unruly craving, sorrow falls away like drops of water on a lotus leaf” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp336/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.336</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp401/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.401</a>.

Flowers were associated with auspicious events. The Nidānakathā describes how all the plants in the universe burst into flower as the Buddha attained enlightenment. “Flowering trees in the ten thousand world-systems sprung into bloom and fruit-bearing trees were weighed down with bunches of fruit. Flowers that blossom on tree trunk, branches and vines did so each in their respective places.

After harvesting, it was tied into sheaves and beaten with flails <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.248/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.iv.201</a>. Barley was used as food, fodder and in brewing. A popular preparation was called <em>yāvaka</em> <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.373</span> which Pāṇinī says was made by pounding barley in a mortar to remove the chaff and boiling it in either water or milk and then adding sugar.

He said: “When a barley field is ready, the contamination, the chaff, the rubbish of barley may appear, its root, stalk and leaf the same as true barley but without the same head. Only when the head forms do the farmers know ‘This is the contamination, the chaff, the rubbish of the true barley’ and knowing this they pull it out by the roots and throw it outside the barley field. And why? Because they think ‘Let it not contaminate the true barley’ ”<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.10/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.iv.169</a>. This is probably referring to Wild Barley, <em>Hordeum spontaneum</em>, the ancestor of <em>H. vulgae</em>, which looks very similar to it except that it has a shorter stem, narrower leaves and a smaller head.

Some of the different root systems mentioned include large woody roots (<em>mūla</em>), tap roots and lateral roots (<em>mūlāni ahogamāniyāni</em> <em>tiriyaṅgamāni</em>), feeder roots (<em>nāḷi</em>), spreading roots (<em>mūlasantānaka</em>), hair roots (<em>mattāni</em>, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.54/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.87–8</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.101/en/sujato#6.1'>SN.iii.155</a>, and in the case of some other plants, tubers (<em><a href='/define/āluka'>āluka</a></em> or <em>āluva</em>, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja446/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.iv.46</a>) and bulbous roots (<em><a href='/define/kanda'>kanda</a></em>, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn3/en/sujato#2.3.1'>DN.i.101</a>).

It was understood that roots absorb moisture and nutrition from the soil and that the sap (<em><a href='/define/ojā'>ojā</a></em>) moves upwards through the trunk into the branches and leaves. The <em>Visuddhimagga</em> says: “When a great tree is growing on the earth, nourished by the essence of humus and, with that as condition, its roots and trunk, branches and shoots, foliage, flowers and fruit grow so it fills the sky and continues the tree’s species until the end of the aeon, one cannot say that the essence of humus is only found in the roots but not in the trunk or in the fruit but not in the roots, and so on. And why? Because it spreads throughout the whole tree from the roots upwards” <span class='ref'>Vism.688</span>. The Buddha said: “Just as a tree that has been cut down can grow again if its root is undamaged and complete, in the same way this suffering returns again and again if the tendency to craving is not removed” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp338/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.338</a>.

Very large and majestic trees were sometimes called <em>vanaspati</em>, “forest lords” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn41.9/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.iv.302</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-pj2/en/brahmali#3.20'>Vin.iii.47</a>.</p><p>The Buddha encouraged monks and nuns to seek solitary lodgings in the forest <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.259/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.ii.250</a>, “at the roots of trees, mountain slopes, a glen, a hill cave, a cemetery or a woodland grove” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn107/en/sujato#6.1'>MN.iii.3</a>. He said: “The one who wears rag-robes, who is lean, with protruding veins and who meditates alone in the forest - him I call a true Brahmin” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp395/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.395</a>. Some monks tried living in hollow trees and in the fork of trees <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd3/en/brahmali#12.1.2'>Vin.i.152</a>. A forest-dwelling monk was advised not to settle down at the foot of a tree on a border, one used as a shrine, one from which resin or fruit was collected, one in which flying foxes roost, a hollow tree or one growing in a monastery <span class='ref'>Vism.74</span>.</p><p>However, forests could also be frightening places; they were the abode of dangerous animals and bandits and travelers could get lost in them <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.48/en/sujato#5.1'>AN.i.153</a> <span class='ref'>Ja.i.320</span> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn7.18/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.i.181</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn22.84/en/sujato#7.1'>SN.iii.108</a>. The Buddha commented that when he lived in the forest before his enlightenment sometimes at night “an animal would prowl around, a peacock would snap a twig or the wind would rustle the leaves” and he would be filled with terror <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn31/en/sujato#19.1'>MN.i.210</a>. Those entering the forest had to be careful of what fruit they ate as some were poisonous <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.200</span>. Some forested areas were thorny, unpleasant and difficult to walk through without getting cut or scratched <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.244/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.iv.189</a>.</p><p>Trees, whether wild or cultivated, provided people with many useful products, the main ones being fuel for fire and material for building. People gathered fire wood in forests <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn7.17/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.180</a> and the Jātaka says: “Forests are made of (potential) fire wood” <span class='ref'>Ja.i.289</span>. Once the Buddha met King Pasenadi’s minister of works while he was supervising the cutting of timber in a sal forest <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn7.16/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.179</a>. The Bhaddasāla Jātaka makes the interesting comment that all the royal palaces in India were supported by numerous columns, some of which must have been wooden. It seems that the king of Benares wanted to construct a magnificent palace supported by a single column and commanded his officers to find a tree trunk big enough for the purpose. They went to the forest and located enough such trees but the state of the roads, they reported to the king, would not allow for the transportation of such a huge log <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.153</span>.</p><p>Fences and kraals were made out of the branches of thorn trees <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd16/en/brahmali#3.8.18'>Vin.ii.154</a>. The leaves of certain trees were used to make various household articles like baskets, fans and plates and were used as wrappers for food <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn56.31/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.v.438</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja547/pli/ms#197.1'>Ja.vi.510</a>. Parasols could be made out of leaves <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.79</span>. The seed pods (<em>sipātikā</em>) of some trees contained down (<em><a href='/define/tūla'>tūla</a></em>) which could be used to stuff pillows and pad furniture and saddles.</p><p>Another product of trees that a use was found for was the bark (<em>taca</em>, <em>vāka</em> or <em><a href='/define/vakkala'>vakkala</a></em>, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.46/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.i.152</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn8/en/sujato#14.10'>DN.i.167</a> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.13</span> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn30/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.i.198</a>). Household articles like fans and ropes are occasionally mentioned as being made out of bark <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja368/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.iii.204</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#22.1.11'>Vin.ii.130</a>. Ascetics are often described as being dressed in <em><a href='/define/vakkala'>vakkala</a></em> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.92/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.i.240</a> <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.274</span>. Although this is usually taken to mean a type of cloth made from bark this may not be the case. More likely it was made out of fibers from the phloem or inner bark of some type of tree or trees. <em><a href='/define/Vakkala'>Vakkala</a></em> clothing made a rustling noise as the wearer moved <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.274</span>. The commentary to the Nidānakathā mentions some of the benefits of this unusual type of clothing. It is cheap, it can be made by oneself, it is hard to get dirty and easy to wash, it is easy to mend, it is not difficult to get a new one when the old one is worn out, it is suitable for the ascetic life, thieves do not bother to steal it, it does not beautify the wearer, it is light to wear, it is conducive to contentment, it can be obtained by righteous means and if it is lost it causes no regret <span class='ref'>Ja.i.9</span>. <em><a href='/define/Vakkala'>Vakkala</a></em> might have also refered to ordinary cotton or hemp cloth colored with a dye made from the bark of the <em><a href='/define/tirīṭa'>tirīṭa</a></em> tree <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#50.1'>DN.i.66</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn51/en/sujato#8.1'>MN.i.343</a>. There are occasional references to ascetics wearing wood fibers (<em>darucīraka</em>), which might be an alternitave name for <em><a href='/define/vakkala'>vakkala</a></em> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud4.3/en/sujato#5.1'>Ud.39</a>, or wearing <em><a href='/define/phalaka'>phalaka</a></em>, which may have been wooden slats or even wood shavings <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd10/en/brahmali#6.3.44'>Vin.i.360</a>. These and similar unusual clothing are described as the “characteristic of ascetics of other sects” and were not allowed to be worn by Buddhist monks <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd8/en/brahmali#28.2.11'>Vin.i.306</a>.</p><p>The Buddha encouraged the planting of fruit trees along roads to offer both shade and food for travelers <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn1.45/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.33</a>. We read of a man tapping tree trunks with his axe to find hollow ones to use as water pipes <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an8.10/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.iv.170</a> and another doing so to find hollows where bees might be nesting <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.200</span>. Sometimes as an act of merit, people would repair roads by filling in pot holes, removing large stones and cutting down the trees that might strike the axles of passing chariots and carts <span class='ref'>Ja.i.199</span>. Certain trees were cultivated for their fruit, flowers, foliage and timber. To grow successfully, a sapling had to have its roots cleared of weeds from time to time, be fertilized with humus (<em>paṁsu</em>) and be regularly watered <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn12.56/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.ii.89</a>. People believed that spirits lived in medical herbs and trees (<em>ārāmadevatā</em>, <em>rukkhadevatā</em>, <em>vanadevatā</em>, <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#9.1'>AN.iii.369</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn45/en/sujato#4.1'>MN.i.307</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn41.9/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.iv.302</a>), particularly very old, gnarled or beautiful ones. These spirits lived in the hollow of trees or in their crowns <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja98/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.i.405</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja109/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.i.423</a>. Before cutting a tree, a woodsman would inform the tree spirit of his intentions and make offerings to it <span class='ref'>Ja.i.442</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.114</span>. Other trees were worshipped and given offerings because the spirits were believed to grant wishes. Milk and water were poured on the roots, garlands were hung in the branches, lamps of scented oil were burned around them and cloth was tied around their trunks <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.104</span>. There is the occasional mention of animal and even human sacrifices being made to trees. The victim’s blood was poured around the foot of the tree and the entrails were draped over the branches <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja50/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.i.260</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja353/pli/ms#3.1'>Ja.iii.160</a>. It was believed that trees would give their bounty on condition that they were treated with a degree of respect and the Buddha told a story that illustrates this point. Long ago, the mythical King Koravya had an amazing banyan tree in his realm which bore fruit of exceptional sweetness. Everyone in the realm enjoyed the fruit freely and so there was no reason to guard the tree. But one day a man ate his fill of the fruit then broke a branch and went away. This act of ingratitude so angered the tree spirit that it caused the tree to bear no more fruit <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.54/en/sujato#9.1'>AN.iii.369–70</a>.</p><p>As with other popular beliefs and superstitions the Buddha did not endorse tree worship. He said: “Gripped by fear people go to sacred mountains, groves, parks and trees. But these are not a safe refuge, not the best refuge. By going there one is not freed from all suffering” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp188/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.188</a>-9</span>. However, the Buddha did respect the beliefs of others and when a certain monk cut down a tree worshipped by local people to make way for a monastery he severly rebuked him for doing so <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bu-vb-ss7/en/brahmali#1.1'>Vin.iii.156</a>.</p><p> Some of the most beautiful passages in Buddhist literature relate to trees. The Buddha said of a kindly hospitable person that he was “like a great banyan tree growing on the side of roads that welcomes weary travelers with its cool shade and soothes their tiredness” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja547/pli/ms#304.1'>Ja.vi.526</a>. The general Buddhist attitude of respect for trees is expressed in these words from the Petavatthu: “Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a branch of it should he break, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer...Of the tree in whose shade one sits or lies, not a leaf should he injure, for if he did he would be a betrayer of a friend, an evil doer” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pv21/pli/ms#3.1'>Pv.21:3</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pv21/pli/ms#5.1'>Pv.21:5</a>. The <em>Milindapañha</em> says that the diligent disciple should try to be like a tree. “As a tree makes no distinction in the shade it gives, like this, the meditator should make no distinction between any beings, but develop love equally to thieves, murderers, enemies and to himself” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mil7.7.5/pli/ms#3.1'>Mil.410</a>. The <em>Buddhacarita</em> compares spiritual practice to a tree “the fibers of which are patience, the flowers virtue, the boughs awareness and wisdom, which is rooted in resolution and which bears the fruit of Dhamma”<span class='ref'>Bc.13.65</span>. The <em>Mahāvastu</em> says: “The meritorious person grows like a banyan tree, while the person of little merit becomes stunted like a tree planted in the roadway” <span class='ref'>Mvu.ii.423</span>. In his <em>Bodhicariyāvatāra</em>, the poet Śāntideva wrote of his longing for the peace of the forest life in these words: “The trees do not speak harsh words nor do they try to please by artifice. When shall I have the opportunity to dwell with those happy to live with the trees?”<span class='ref'>Bcv.viii.26</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

Once, when the arrogant young brahmin Ambaṭṭha was visiting the Sākyans, he got the distinct impression that they were whispering about and laughing at him.

Snakes shed their skins <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp1.1/en/sujato#1.1'>Snp verse 1</a>, have forked tongues, long backs, crawl on their bellies <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp3.9/en/sujato#16.1'>Snp verse 604</a> and are commonly found living in anthills <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn35.246/en/sujato#4.1'>SN.iv.197</a>. The reverence people had for snakes was often mixed with fear and disgust <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#23.5.6'>Vin.i.218</a>. The Tipiṭaka contains several accounts of people being bitten by snakes and dying <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.62/en/sujato#6.1'>AN.ii.70</a>. People wore charms to protect themselves from and to cure snake bites <span class='ref'>Ja.vi.178</span>. A doctor could give medicine against a snake bite or force the snake to suck the poison out of the wound <span class='ref'>Ja.i.310</span>. One cure for a snake bite was a concoction of cow dung and urine, ash or clay <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#14.1.2'>Vin.i.205</a>.</p><p>The Buddha said that one should be careful even of young snakes. “One should not dismiss the snake one might see in village or forest just because it is young. But that snake, fierce, sliding along, with serpentine movements, may attack and bite the foolish man or woman. Therefore, protect your life and avoid that snake” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn3.1/en/sujato#3.1'>SN.i.69</a>. Not everyone tried to avoid snakes. We read of children tormenting a snake, probably a small one, with a stick <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud2.2/en/sujato#1.1'>Ud.11</a>. The Buddha described some species of snakes as being dirty and odorous, terrifying, dangerous and given to betraying their friends <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.228/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.260</a>. To catch snakes charmers would pin their heads down with a forked stick and then grasp them by the neck <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn22/en/sujato#10.10'>MN.i.134</a>. The Snake River, Sappinī, at Rājagaha was so named because of its winding serpentine course <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.27/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.ii.27</a>. It was believed that some snakes were born in the Himalayas from where they migrated down the streams and rivers to the sea and then grew into sea monsters <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn45.149/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.v.46</a>. Several types of water snakes are mentioned <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja239/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.ii.238</a>, in particular the <em><a href='/define/alagadda'>alagadda</a></em> which is described as being venomous <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn22/en/sujato#8.1'>MN.i.133</a>. The Tipiṭaka mentions a snake with a copper-colored or red head <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja543/pli/ms#100.1'>Ja.vi.194</a> which can only be the Copper Head, <em>Elaphe radiata</em>. This large handsome snake has a copper-colored or orange head with a black stripe over it and a yellowish-brown body with three black stripes down the sides. The copper head prefers open country near jungles and undergrowth and is often seen in fields and near villages where it feeds almost exclusively on rodents.The Jātaka correctly points out that the copper head is non-venomous.

Finally, he would fix a rudder, make a pair of oars and then slide it down to the river <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.196/en/sujato#5.1'>AN.ii.201</a>.

King Vessavaṇa asked all the tree spirits to select for themselves a plant as their home. The Bodhisattva, who had been reborn as a tree spirit, advised his kinsmen to avoid trees that stood alone and pick those that grew close to others. Some did as he advised, making their homes in a thick sal forest, but others moved into isolated trees growing near towns and villages thinking that they would receive offerings humans made to such trees. One day a mighty storm swept over the country uprooting even the mightiest and most deeply rooted trees growing in the open. But the sal trees in the forest, supported by each other and with their branches interlaced withstood the storm <span class='ref'>Ja.i.328–9</span>.</p><p>When the Buddha arrived in Kusinārā on his last tour and lay down between two sal trees, they burst into flower out of season and sprinkled their petals over him. When Ānanda expressed amazement that the very trees were revering him, the Buddha said: “Ānanda, these sal trees burst into flower out of season in homage to the Tathāgata and covered his body - but the monk or the nun, the lay man or the lay woman who lives practicing the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfills the Dhamma, they honors, reveres and respects the Tathāgata with the highest homage” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#5.1.1'>DN.ii.137–8</a>. In the light of this story and the traditional belief that the Buddha passed away during Vesākha, it is interesting to note that the sal usually blossoms in March-April and occasionally in May. The Buddha once said that his Dhamma was so convincing that if the great sal trees had consciousness and could comprehend, even they would benefit from it <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.193/en/sujato#11.1'>AN.ii.193</a>.</p><p>One moonlit night, Ānanda and Revata went to visit Sāriputta at the sal forest of Gosinga which was “delightful - with all the trees in full bloom and with a heavenly fragrance wafting through the air” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn32/en/sujato#1.1'>MN.i.212</a>. Sometimes gruel was made from or flavored with sal flowers or perhaps its resin <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.43/en/sujato#10.1'>AN.iii.49</a>.

Eventually she came to the Buddha who gently told her to get a white mustard seed from a house in which no one had ever died. Thinking that this seed would miraculously revive her child she went from house to house asking for one. Everyone was willing to give her one of the tiny seeds but when she asked if anyone had ever died in the house she was always told that someone had.

The Buddha said that one of the several unpleasant features of Madhura was the many fierce dogs in the streets <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.218/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.256</a>. Brahmans would cover the food they were eating with a leaf if a dog stood near to prevent it being rendered impure by the animal’s presence.</p><p>We read that when a group of Licchavī youths roaming around in the forest with their weapons and hunting dogs saw the Buddha, they put down their bows and called their dogs to heel <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.57/en/sujato#11.1'>AN.iii.75</a>. One of the austerities practiced by some ascetics was to behave like a dog - going naked, licking their hands after eating and curling up on the ground to sleep <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn24/en/sujato#1.6.13'>DN.iii.6</a> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn56/en/sujato#30.1'>MN.i.387</a>. Some ascetics would refuse to accept alms if a dog was standing nearby or flies were swarming, probably so as not to deprive them of food <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an3.152/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.i.294</a>. In one of his most severe criticisms of brahmins, the Buddha compared them unfavorably with dogs <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.184/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.220</a>. Outcastes used to eat dogs <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thig16.1/en/sujato#62.1'>Thig.509</a>. The various Pāḷi names for the domestic dog were probably also used for the Asiatic Wild Dog, Hindi <em>dhol</em>, <em>Cuon alpinus</em>, a reddish brown forest-living canine with shorter legs and a more bushy tail than the domestic dog. Wild dogs hunt in packs and communicate with each other by a whistling sound. The Asiatic wild dog is now extinct in northern India and increasingly rare in other parts of the sub-continent. According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was once reborn as a dog <span class='ref'>Ja.i.175</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

About the size of the domestic goose, this beautiful bird has gray, brown and white plumage with a white head and neck marked by two distinctive black bands. The bird’s gentle musical “<em>aang aang aang</em>” call is often praised in ancient Indian literature. The famous ornithologist Salim Ali describes it as “one of the most unforgettable and exhilarating sounds” to be heard in nature. Vaṅgīsa addressed the Buddha saying: “Quickly send forth your melodious voice, oh Beautiful One. Like geese stretching out their necks, honk gently with your soft well-modulated voice” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp2.12/en/sujato#9.1'>Snp verse 350</a>. Bar-headed geese are often seen during the winter feeding in swamps and fields, and then in mid-March they fly off to nest in Tibet. To the Buddha this migratory behavior was suggestive of detachment. “Mindful people exert themselves. They are not attached to any home. Like geese that quit their lakes, they leave one abode after another behind” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp91/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.91</a>. “Geese fly the path to the sun, sages fly by their psychic powers. Having defeated Māra and his army the wise are led away from the world” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp175/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.175</a>. Piṅgiya used the geese’s arrival back in northern India in October as a metaphor for the coming of something wonderful. “Just as a bird might leave a small wood to dwell in a forest full of fruit, so do I, having left narrow-minded teachers, come to He of Wide Vision, like a goose arriving at a great lake” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp5.19/en/sujato#4.1'>Snp verse 1134</a>. One of the most beautiful legends in the whole of the Buddhist tradition comes from the Sanskrit <em>Abhiniṣkramaṇa Sūtra</em> and concerns a bar-headed goose. Once, while walking through the palace garden, Prince Siddhattha saw a goose fall from the sky with an arrow lodged in its wing. He gently nestled the bird in his lap, extracted the arrow and anointed the wound with oil and honey. Soon afterwards, Devadatta sent a message to the palace saying that he had shot the bird and demanding that it be returned to him. Siddhattha replied to the message by saying “If the goose was dead I would return it forthwith. But as it is still alive you have no right to it.” Devadatta sent a second message arguing that it was his skill that had downed the goose and as such it belonged to him. Again Siddhattha refused to give his cousin the bird and asked that an assembly of wise men be called to settle the dispute. This was done and after discussing the matter for some time the most senior of the wise men gave his opinion, saying “The living belongs to he who cherishes and preserves life, not to he who tries to destroy life”. The assembly agreed with this and Prince Siddhattha was allowed to keep the goose.</p><p>According to the Jātaka, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as a bar-headed goose <span class='ref'>Ja.iii.208</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.246</span> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.423</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

The Pāḷi, Bengali and Hindi word <em>hatthī</em> means “one with a hand” and refers to the dexterous way elephants use their trunks.</p><p>Slightly smaller than its African cousin, the Asian elephant has grey wrinkled skin, a long trunk, a two-domed head and drooping ears. They can grow up to 3 meters at the shoulders and weigh as much as 5,000 kilograms. Asian elephants prefer thick or light jungle and eat the leaves, bark and fruit of trees, grass and aquatic vegetation. They will also raid fields and orchards. In his famous parable of the blind men and the elephant the Buddha described the elephant’s ears as being like a winnowing basket, its tusks (<em>danta</em> or <em>hatthidanta</em>) like plough poles, the body like a granary, the legs like pillars, the tail is like a pestle and the tuft of the tail like a broom <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud6.4/en/sujato#16.1'>Ud.68–9</a>. The frontal lobes of the elephant’s head were called “pots” (<em>kumbha</em>) and the trusks, the small tusks on females, were known as <em>kaḷārikā</em> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn27/en/sujato#8.5'>MN.i.178</a>. Temporin, the odorous tar-like secretion that oozes from the males during must, was called <em>kaṭuka</em> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp324/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.324</a>. The ancient Indians revered the elephant for its strength, nobility and intelligence and elephants are mentioned in the Tipiṭaka more than any other animal. Elephants lived in certain forests <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn125/en/sujato#12.1'>MN.iii.132</a>, probably because they offered better shelter, food and water than other places. Males were believed to avoid the cows and their calves so that they would not be bothered by them or have to eat the leaves and grass that they had already cropped or drink the water they had muddied <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an9.40/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iv.435</a>. It was noticed that elephants have very particular behavior; when they charge they spread their ears and make their tails erect <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd17/en/brahmali#3.10.1'>Vin.ii.194</a>, they sniff the dung of other elephants <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.138/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.iii.157</a> and they dislike heat <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn21/en/sujato#1.5.9'>DN.ii.266</a>. Males regularly go into must when temporin flows from their ears <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp324/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.324</a> and they become aggressive and unruly so that their mahouts have to hold them in check <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp326/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.326</a>. At such times they may kill people or even knock down dwellings <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja510/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.iv.494</a>. Elephants enjoy swimming and they amuse themselves by squirting water into their ears and over their backs <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.97/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.v.201</a>. They pull up lotus stalks, wash them to get the mud off and then eat them <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn20.9/en/sujato#2.1'>SN.ii.269</a>. A bull elephant might be seven or eight cubits high <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an10.97/en/sujato#12.1'>AN.v.201</a> and some could live for 60 years or more <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn35/en/sujato#5.1'>MN.i.229</a>. Elephants were domesticated in India at least 1,500 years before the Buddha’s time. Trackers skilled in reading the marks left by them - footprints, the scrapings of their tusks on trees, broken foliage, etc - were employed to find the animals <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn27/en/sujato#8.5'>MN.i.178</a>. Domesticated elephants would be used to capture the wild ones <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn125/en/sujato#12.1'>MN.iii.132</a>. Once caught, the trainer had to subdue the creature’s forest habits, memories and behavior, subdue its distress, fret and fever over missing the forest, and get it used to towns and people. The tamer used gentle kind words and the elephant would gradually respond and begin eating again. Then the trainer would teach the elephant commands like “Take up!” “Put down!” “Go forward!” “Go back!” “Get up!” “Sit down!” After that, it would be taught what was called “endurance.” A plank was tied to the elephant’s trunk, a man would sit on its back and then it would be surrounded by other men who would poke it with poles and spears and make a great racket while the trainer would command it not to move <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn125/en/sujato#12.1'>MN.iii.132–33</a>. To mount a trained elephant the mahout would take his hook and say: “Give me your foot” and the elephant would bend its knee so the mahout climbs on its back <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/thig3.4/en/sujato#2.1'>Thig.49</a>. When domesticated elephants heard the roar of the lion they would strain at and break the leather bonds that held them, defecate, panic and run around <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.31/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.ii.32</a>. Because of their value, there were veterinarians specializing in elephant health <span class='ref'>Ja.i.485</span>. Ivory was a much-prized product. Bracelets, boxes for eye-salve, caskets, ornament boxes in fantastic shapes, vases and anklets were made out of it. There is mention of a mirror handle being made out of ivory <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja531/pli/ms#37.1'>Ja.v.302</a>. There was a bazaar of ivory workers in Vārānasi <span class='ref'>Ja.i.320</span>. A type of curved wall peg was called “elephant tusk” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#9.2.15'>Vin.ii.113</a> and one way of wearing the monks” under robe was to role it up at the front rather than fold it, a style known as “the elephant’s trunk” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd15/en/brahmali#29.1.5'>Vin.ii.136</a>. The capitals of pillars in buildings were sometimes carved to resemble elephants <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd16/en/brahmali#13.1.10'>Vin.ii.169</a>. Domesticated elephants were used for work, transportation, in warfare and to enhance royal glory. The elephant brigade was one of the four traditional branches of the army, the others being cavalry, chariots and infantry <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn5/en/sujato#12.1'>DN.i.137</a>. Being crushed by an elephant was a form of capital punishment <span class='ref'>Ja.i.200</span>. In battle, elephants would take great care to protect their softest and most vulnerable part, their trunk <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn61/en/sujato#3.1'>MN.i.415</a>. A large tusked elephant was an essential possession for a monarch. King Ajātasattu rode his royal tusker from Rājagaha to meet the Buddha at Jīvaka’s Mango Grove <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn2/en/sujato#7.1'>DN.i.49</a>. Once, the Buddha and Ānanda were bathing in the river at Sāvatthī when Seta, King Pasenadi’s elephant, arrived to the accompaniment of music. Soon an admiring crowd had gathered to watch, commenting “What a beauty! What a sight! What a delight for the eye! What a body! Now that really is an elephant!” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.43/en/sujato#1.1'>AN.iii.345</a>. An elephant fit to be a royal mount in war had to have four qualities. It had to respond well to training. In battle it had to destroy other elephants and their mahouts as well as cavalry, chariots and their drivers and footmen. It was expected to endure the injuries of spears, swords, arrows and axes and the din of drums, conchs and other noises, and it was expected to go in whichever direction the mahout directed it <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.113/en/sujato#4.1'>AN.ii.115</a>.</p><p>One of the skills taught to princes along with horsemanship, archery, swordsmanship and chariot driving, was the art of training, riding and caring for elephants <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an5.134/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.iii.152</a>. This was called elephant lore <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an6.30/en/sujato#2.1'>AN.iii.326</a>. During a food shortage the king’s elephant died and people ate it <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd6/en/brahmali#23.5.6'>Vin.i.218</a>. The rare white elephant was particularly prized <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja71/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.i.319</a> and one of the accoutrements of a universal Monarch was a pure white elephant of sevenfold strength <span class='ref'>DN.ii.174</span>. The mount of Indra, the king of the gods, was a magnificent elephant named Erāvana <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/snp2.14/en/sujato#5.1'>Snp verse 379</a> or sometimes Maghavā. <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/sn11.12/en/sujato#1.1'>SN.i.229</a>. Some lay people were rich enough to be able to own elephants. When Soṇa became a monk, he said he had renounced everything he owned including “a herd of seven elephants”, the implication being that he had been very wealthy <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd5/en/brahmali#1.22.3'>Vin.i.184</a>.</p><p>The Buddha seems to have had a special fondness for elephants. The animal’s mindful and deliberate behavior and particularly the male’s penchant for living alone in the jungle, impressed him. “On this matter the enlightened sage and the elephant with tusks as long as plough poles agree, they both love the solitude of the forest” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ud4.5/en/sujato#4.1'>Ud.42</a>. In some ways the Buddha even considered elephants to be better than humans. The elephant trainer Pessa once said to him: “Humans are a tangle while animals are straightforward. I can drive an elephant undergoing training and in the time it takes to make a trip to and from Campa, that elephant will display every kind of deception, duplicity, trickery and fraud. But our servants, messengers and employees, they say one thing, do another and think something else.” The Buddha agreed with this observation <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/mn51/en/sujato#3.6'>MN.i.340</a>. He often compared himself to or was compared by others with an elephant <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.35/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.ii.36</a>. When Doṇa encountered him sitting at the foot of a tree, he appeared “beautiful, faith-inspiring, with calm senses and a serene mind, utterly composed and controlled like a tamed, alert, perfectly trained elephant” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/an4.35/en/sujato#3.1'>AN.ii.36</a>. The Buddha never looked over his shoulder when he wanted to see behind him but turned around completely as does an elephant. This was called his “elephant look” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dn16/en/sujato#4.1.1'>DN.ii.122</a>.</p><p>Throughout the Tipiṭaka, the Buddha advised his disciples to respond to difficulties as would an elephant. “I shall endure abuse as a bull elephant in battle endures the arrows shot from the bow. For indeed, ill-natured people are many”<a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp320/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.320</a>. “Formerly this mind wandered wherever it wished, where it liked and as it pleased. But today I shall completely control it as a mahout controls an elephant in must” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp326/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.326</a>. “Rejoice in awareness and guard your mind well. Pull yourself out of evil as does an elephant stuck in the mud” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp327/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.327</a>. “If you do not find a wise, zealous and virtuous companion to wander with, then like a king abandoning his conquered realm, wander alone like a bull elephant in the forest” <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/dhp329/en/sujato#1'>Dhp.329</a>. Elephants are frequently mentioned in the Jātaka where they are usually depicted as noble, kindly and intelligent creatures. According to the Jātakas, the Bodhisattva was sometimes reborn as an elephant <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja71/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.i.319</a> <span class='ref'>Ja.i.444</span> <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/ja357/pli/ms#1.1'>Ja.iii.174</a> <span class='ref'>Ja.iv.90</span> and once as a human he worked as an elephant trainer <span class='ref'>Ja.ii.94</span>.</p></dd></dl>"

Together with <em><a href='/define/āmalaka'>āmalaka</a></em> and <em><a href='/define/vibhītaka'>vibhītaka</a></em> the fruit of this tree is one of the “<em>triphalā</em>” or three fruits, long credited in traditional Indian medicine with powerful curative properties. When ripe, the bright-yellow fruits are allowed to fall and then collected and used in tanning and as a medicine. While staying at Uruvelā the Buddha plucked a yellow myrobalan fruit <a class='ref' href='https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-kd1/en/brahmali#20.7.1'>Vin.i.30</a>. According to the <em>Mahāvastu</em>, the Buddha planted a Yellow Myrobalan tree when he was at Uruvelā. It adds the comment: “The myrobalans which grew from this tree are today known as the Consecrated Myrobalan Wood”<span class='ref'>Mvu.iii.311</span>. When the Chinese monk Yijing was in India in the 7<sup>th</sup> century he was told of ways to use yellow myrobalan as a medicine. “Take equal measures of <em>harītaka</em> bark, dry ginger and granulated sugar. Pound the first two into a powder and mix it with the sugar and some water and then form the paste into pills. Take no more than ten pills in the morning and do not abstain from eating. No more than two or three doses will be sufficient to cure a patient with diarrhea. It will dissolve the gas in the stomach, dispense cold and help digestion... If no granulated sugar is available maltose or honey can be used. If one chews one piece of <em>harītaka</em> and swallows the juice every day, one will be free from disease the whole of one’s life.”</p></dd><dt>Medical uses for <td><em>Harītaka</em></td></dt><dd class='uses'><p>Bark: As diuretic, cardiotonic, for eczema, mouth sores.
