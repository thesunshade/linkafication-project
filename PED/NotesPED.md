## Pv
Pv.iii.9#1 is to Pv chapter 3 sutta 9 verse 1
Pv.iii.5#10 is to Pv chapter 3 sutta 5 verse 11 So it is off by one
Pv.iii.6#14 is to Pv chapter 3 sutta 6 verse 15 So it is off by one (and ms version is different than the PTS edition)

## Khp

Citations have been changed to Khp in the json where I could confirm they are really to Kp

# Thag
There is a single citation to Thag p.1, probably because it's in the preliminary verse

## Mnd

Mnd citations seem to all be to the page number in the Pali edition. The only exception are the below citations that are either out of range, or in one case, not there. 


* Mnd.512
* Mnd.550
* Mnd.553
* Mnd.558
* Mnd.581 (vipula) not a typo in PED, can't find in book
* Mnd.611
* Mnd.616 (saṅkappa) not a typo in PED, can't find in book
* Mnd.342#1b (pavivitta) not a typo in PED, can't find in book

## Cnd

Cnd citations go from 1 to 697. However the PTS page numbers only go up to 73 on SuttaCentral. 

There are 1415 Cnd citations in PED in total.


# Major Issues

## Vinaya

Volume 3 is split between the Bhikkhu and Bhikkuni vibhanga, pli-tv-bu-vb and pli-tv-bu-vb.

## Pv

There are 2296 citations to the Pv in the form of i–iv chapters, sutta number, and sometimes verse number (which often, but not always is the same as in bilara)

There doesn't seem to be a way using the refrences to calculate the url. 

## Cp
Except for 5 oddballs, there are ~81 Cp citations in the form of i–iii and then sutta number, sometimes followed by a # and then the verse number.. The native numbering on SC goes from 1–35.

There doesn't seem to be a way using the refrences to calculate the url. 

## Dhammasaṅgaṇī (Ds)

Aprox 1,741 citations. They range from 1 to 1,596. It appears that the PED is referencing the paragraph(??) numbers in the 1885 edition. They don't appear to be in the manuscript. They are close to msdiv but those numbers go up to 1616. And the pts 1599 == msdiv 1616.
I haven’t tried to figure out exactly where the numbers diverge. They are the same at 557. At msdiv1063, PTS is at 1057.








Pp.83 doesn't seem to exist. Check scan "word": "parinibbāyin",



Kp.viii.1 seems to be Khp8 verse 1
However many Kp seem to be part of a list where it starts with Tikp


Pv citations are in the form of roman numerals for chapters and then sutta in chapter. However on SC they are numbered consecutively.


Sdhp.239 these are well formed but the book abbreviation doesn't exist. 1414 of them
Dhtm.322 these are well formed but the book abbreviation doesn't exist. 130 of them
Vb.54 these are well formed but the book abbreviation doesn't exist. 1218 of them
Tha-ap has 1-333 plus Tha-ap.v.3, Tha-ap.v.8
