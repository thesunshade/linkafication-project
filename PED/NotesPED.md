## Vinaya

Volume 3 is split between the Bhikkhu and Bhikkuni vibhanga, pli-tv-bu-vb and pli-tv-bu-vb.


## Dhammasaṅgaṇī (Ds)

Aprox 1,741 citations. They range from 1 to 1,596. It appears that the PED is referencing the paragraph(??) numbers in the 1885 edition. They don't appear to be in the manuscript. They are close to msdiv but those numbers go up to 1616. And the pts 1599 == msdiv 1616.
I haven’t tried to figure out exactly where the numbers diverge. They are the same at 557. At msdiv1063, PTS is at 1057.



Pp.83 doesn't seem to exist. Check scan "word": "parinibbāyin",



Kp.viii.1 seems to be Khp8 verse 1
However many Kp seem to be part of a list where it starts with Tikp


Pv citations are in the form of roman numerals for chapters and then sutta in chapter. However on SC they are numbered consecutively.


Sdhp.239 these are well formed but the book abbreviation doesn't exist. 1414 of them
Dhtm.322 these are well formed but the book abbreviation doesn't exist. 130 of them
Vb.54 these are well formed but the book abbreviation doesn't exist. 1218 of them
Tha-ap has 1-333 plus Tha-ap.v.3, Tha-ap.v.8
Pv-a.139
Snp.787
Vism.197
Iti.92
Kv.508
Lal.340
Mvu.iii.385
Dhs.981
Pp.19
